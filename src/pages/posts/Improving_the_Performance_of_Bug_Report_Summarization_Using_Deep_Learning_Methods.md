## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

Our research focuses on enhancing bug report summarization through deep learning methods. We explore how intent detection can improve summarization performance and investigate various classifiers for optimal results.

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology

### Feature Engineering
We focused on four main feature categories:
- Structure features
- Participant features
- Length features
- Lexical features

### Models
- Intent Classification using BRIC model with BiLSTM
- Summarization Models:
  - Logistic Regression (LR)
  - Random Forest (RF) 
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XG)

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

| Model     | Precision | Recall | F-score |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| BRC2014   | 0.428     | 0.453  | 0.440   |
| IBRS      | 0.430     | 0.454  | 0.442   |
| BRIC+BRC  | 0.432     | 0.451  | 0.441   |

### Key Findings
- SVM shows best overall performance in BRC and IBRS models
- Random Forest excels in BRIC+BRC model
- Intent detection improves performance with LR and RF
